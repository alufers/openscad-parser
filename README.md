# openscad-parser

This package facilitates parsing, formatting and validating the OpenSCAD language using TypeScript and JavaScript.

# Installation (formatter)

```sh
$ npm i -g openscad-parser
```

Usage:
```sh
$ scadfmt <file> # outputs the formatted OpenSCAD code to stdout
```

# Installation (as a node module)

```sh
npm install openscad-parser
```

# Features

- [x] Parsing and full error reporting (reports even better errors than the default OpenSCAD parser)
- [x] Symbol tree generation (VSCode "Outline" view)
- [x] Formatting (fully AST-aware, needs some more work with breaking up large vectors)
- [x] Semantic code completions (provides code completions for VSCode)

I will soon release a vscode extension with full OpenSCAD support, it just needs some more work.
